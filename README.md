**OnChainTrust: An AI-Enhanced Blockchain Trust Evaluation Platform**

### **Project Overview**

OnChainTrust is an innovative blockchain trust evaluation platform designed to help users assess the credibility of blockchain projects, wallet addresses, and transactions. By combining blockchain data analytics with cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) technology, OnChainTrust aims to provide users with reliable trust scores and detailed insights into the trustworthiness of blockchain entities. This project addresses the growing need for transparency and security in the decentralized ecosystem.

### **Problem Statement**

The blockchain ecosystem is rapidly expanding, but it is plagued by challenges such as:
1. **Fraudulent Activities**: Scams, phishing attacks, and malicious projects are increasingly common.
2. **Lack of Transparent Metrics**: Users often struggle to verify the trustworthiness of blockchain entities due to the absence of standardized evaluation frameworks.
3. **Overwhelming Data**: The sheer volume of on-chain data makes it difficult for users to analyze and extract meaningful insights.

These challenges discourage users and investors from participating in the blockchain ecosystem, slowing down adoption and growth.

### **Solution**

OnChainTrust solves these issues by leveraging AI-driven analytics and blockchain data to provide:
1. **Trust Scores**: Evaluate the reliability of wallet addresses and projects based on transaction history, patterns, and associated metadata.
2. **Anomaly Detection**: Detect suspicious activities, such as wash trading, pump-and-dump schemes, and unusually large transactions.
3. **Community Insights**: Analyze on-chain and off-chain data, including social media and community sentiment, to provide a holistic trust evaluation.
4. **Personalized Recommendations**: Suggest trustworthy addresses, projects, or actions based on user behavior and preferences.

### **Key Features**

#### 1. **AI-Powered Trust Evaluation**
- **Machine Learning Models**: Analyze transaction histories and user interactions to calculate dynamic trust scores.
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify anomalies and patterns indicative of fraudulent activities.

#### 2. **On-Chain and Off-Chain Data Integration**
- **On-Chain Data**: Utilize APIs such as Etherscan to fetch transaction details, smart contract interactions, and wallet histories.
- **Off-Chain Data**: Scrape and analyze social media content, project whitepapers, and community feedback using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

#### 3. **Risk Alerts and Reports**
- **Automated Alerts**: Notify users about high-risk addresses or projects.
- **Comprehensive Reports**: Generate detailed reports summarizing trust scores and risk factors.

#### 4. **User-Friendly Interface**
- **Web App**: Intuitive dashboard for visualizing trust scores and insights.
- **API Access**: Allow developers to integrate trust evaluation services into their own applications.

### **Target Audience**

1. **Retail Investors**: Individuals seeking to invest in blockchain projects but are concerned about scams and fraud.
2. **Blockchain Developers**: Teams building decentralized applications (dApps) who want to ensure their platforms interact with trustworthy entities.
3. **Institutions**: Financial institutions and compliance teams requiring risk assessment tools for blockchain interactions.

### **Technology Stack**

1. **Backend**:
   - Python (Flask/Django)
   - AI Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn
   - Database: PostgreSQL for structured data, MongoDB for unstructured data

2. **Frontend**:
   - React.js for a responsive user interface
   - Chart.js/D3.js for data visualization

3. **Blockchain Integration**:
   - Etherscan API, Alchemy, or Infura for fetching on-chain data
   - Web3.js or ethers.js for smart contract interactions

4. **AI/ML Modules**:
   - Anomaly Detection: Isolation Forest, Autoencoders
   - Sentiment Analysis: NLP models (Hugging Face Transformers)
   - Trust Scoring: Logistic Regression, Random Forest

5. **Hosting**:
   - Vercel for frontend hosting
   - AWS or Google Cloud for backend and AI model deployment

### **Proposed Roadmap**
